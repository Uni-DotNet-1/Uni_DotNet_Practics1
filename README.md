#**Practical Labs 1**

Task 1. **Basic Calculator**:
   - **Task**: Write a C# method `BasicCalculator` that takes two numbers and one string (operation) as input and allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on these numbers.
   - **Objective**: Familiarize with basic arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in C#.

Task 2. **Temperature Converter**:
   - **Task**: Develop a C# program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius (method `FahrenheitToCelsius`) and vice versa (method `CelsiusToFahrenheit`). The methods should take the numeric parameter as input (a temperature).
   - **Objective**: Practice working with  mathematical formulas, and decision-making logic in C#.

Task 3. **String Manipulation: Palindrome Checker**:
   - **Task**: Create a method `IsPalindrome` that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
	In case of the given string is palindrome the output of function should be `true`. In other case - `false`.
   - **Objective**: Strengthen understanding of string manipulation, loops, and conditionals in C#. This task will also introduce students to the concept of algorithms in a simple and understandable way.
